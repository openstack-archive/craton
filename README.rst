Craton
======

Craton is a new project we plan to propose for OpenStack inclusion.
Craton supports deploying and operating OpenStack clouds by providing
scalable fleet management:

* Inventory of configurable physical devices/hosts (the fleet)
* Audit and remediation workflows against this inventory
* REST APIs, CLI, and Python client to manage

Support for workflows, CLI, and the Python client is in progress.
